Please analyze my project and:

1. Check `ApiProjectCreator.scala` in the `03-api` module and identify any missing domain objects that should be documented in the `document()` section
2. Check `WorkerApp.scala` in the `03-worker` module and identify any missing workers that should be added to the `workers()` section
3. Add any missing entries to both files
4. Check if there are missing Simulations, like a UserTask is not used etc. Use `ApiProjectCreator.scala` as a reference what should be simulated.

Look for:
- Domain objects in `01-domain/src/main/scala/democompany/cards/domain/` that extend `CompanyBpmnProcessDsl` or `CompanyBpmnUserTaskDsl`
- Worker classes in `03-worker/src/main/scala/democompany/cards/worker/` that extend worker DSL traits
- Ensure the imports and references are correct for each module

Please show me what's missing and provide the updated code for both files.
